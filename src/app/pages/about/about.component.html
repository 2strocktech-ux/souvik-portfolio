  <p #item class="about-lead">
    Full Stack Developer with over five years of experience
    building enterprise web applications using Angular,
    .NET, and SQL Server.
  </p>

  <p #item>
    Most of my work focuses on ERP, HRMS, and internal business systems
    where performance, data accuracy, and long-term stability matter.
    I spend a lot of time designing clean UI structures,
    handling complex data flows, and improving legacy applications.
  </p>

  <p #item>
    I care deeply about maintainable architecture, predictable user
    experience, and writing code that teams can easily understand,
    extend, and rely on in production.
